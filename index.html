                    <b>Vivekananda</b>, original name <b>Narendranath Datta</b>, Datta also spelled <b>Dutt</b>, (born
                    January 12, 1863, Calcutta [now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata">Kolkata</a>]—died July 4, 1902, near Calcutta), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus">Hindu</a> spiritual
                    leader and reformer in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</a> who attempted to combine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian">Indian</a> spirituality with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western">Western</a> material
                    progress, maintaining that the two supplemented and complemented one another. His Absolute was a
                    person's own higher self; to labour for the benefit of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/humanity">humanity</a> was the noblest endeavour.
                </p><br>
                <p>Born into an upper-middle-class family of the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/k%C4%81yastha">Kayastha</a> (scribes) <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/caste">caste</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal">West Bengal</a>, he was educated
                    at a Western-style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University">university</a> where he was exposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy">Western philosophy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity">Christianity</a>, and
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">science</a>. Social reform became a prominent element of Vivekananda's thought, and he joined the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmo_Samaj">Brahmo Samaj</a> (Society of Brahma), dedicated to eliminating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage">child marriage</a> and illiteracy and
                    determined to spread <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education">education</a> among women and the lower castes. He later became the
                    most-notable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciple">disciple</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramakrishna">Ramakrishna</a>, who demonstrated the essential unity of all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion">religion</a>s.</p><br>
                <p>Always stressing the universal and humanistic side of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas">Vedas</a>, the oldest sacred texts of
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, as well as belief in service rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogma">dogma</a>, Vivekananda attempted to infuse vigour
                    into Hindu thought, placing less emphasis on the prevailing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism">pacifism</a> and presenting Hindu
                    spirituality to the West. He was an activating force in the movement to promote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta">Vedanta</a>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">philosophy</a> (one of the six schools of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy">Indian philosophy</a>) in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">England</a>. In
                    1893 he appeared in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago">Chicago</a> as a spokesman for Hinduism at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_World%27s_Religions">World's Parliament of Religions</a>
                    and so captivated the assembly that a newspaper account described him as <q>an orator by divine
                        right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament">Parliament</a>.</q> Thereafter he lectured
                    throughout the United States and England, making converts to the Vedanta movement.</p><br>
                <p>On his return to India with a small group of Western disciples in 1897, Vivekananda founded the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramakrishna_Mission">Ramakrishna Mission</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery">monastery</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belur_Math">Belur Math</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges">Ganges</a> (Ganga) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River">River</a> near Calcutta
                    (now Kolkata). Self-perfection and service were his ideals, and the order continued to stress
                    them. He adapted and made relevant to the 20th century the very highest ideals of the Vedantic
                    religion, and, although he lived only two years into that century, he left the mark of his
                    personality on East and West alike.</p>

                <h2>Selected Teachings of Swami Vivekananda</h2>
                <p> ☛ <q>Education is the manifestation of the perfection already in man.</q></p>
                <p> ☛ <q>We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect
                    is expanded, and by which one can stand on one's own feet.</q></p>
                <p> ☛ <q>So long as the millions live in hunger and ignorance, I hold every man a traitor who, having been
                    educated at their expense, pays not the least heed to them.</q></p>
                <p> ☛ <q>Whatever you think, that you will be. If you think yourselves weak, weak you will be; if you
                    think yourselves strong, strong you will be.</q></p>
                <p> ☛ <q>Strength, strength it is that we want so much in this life, for what we call sin and sorrow have
                    all one cause, and that is our weakness. With weakness comes ignorance, and with ignorance comes
                    misery.</q></p>
                <p> ☛ <q>The older I grow, the more everything seems to me to lie in manliness. This is my new Gospel.</q></p>
                <p> ☛ <q>Purity, patience, and perseverance are the three essentials to success, and above all, love.</q></p>
                <p> ☛ <q>My ideal, indeed, can be put into a few words, and that is: to preach unto mankind their
                    divinity, and how to make it manifest in every movement of life.</q></p>
                <p> ☛ <q>Religion is realization; not talk, not doctrine, nor theories, however beautiful they may be. It
                    is being and becoming, not hearing or acknowledging; it is the whole soul becoming changed into
                    what it believes.</q></p>
                <p> ☛ <q>Religion is the manifestation of the Divinity already in man.</q></p>
