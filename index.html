                    <b>Vivekananda</b>, original name <b>Narendranath Datta</b>, Datta also spelled Dutt, (born
                    January 12, 1863, Calcutta [now Kolkata]â€”died July 4, 1902, near Calcutta), Hindu spiritual
                    leader and reformer in India who attempted to combine Indian spirituality with Western material
                    progress, maintaining that the two supplemented and complemented one another. His Absolute was a
                    person's own higher self; to labour for the benefit of humanity was the noblest endeavour.
                </p><br>
                <p>Born into an upper-middle-class family of the Kayastha (scribes) caste in Bengal, he was educated
                    at a Western-style university where he was exposed to Western philosophy, Christianity, and
                    science. Social reform became a prominent element of Vivekananda's thought, and he joined the
                    Brahmo Samaj (Society of Brahma), dedicated to eliminating child marriage and illiteracy and
                    determined to spread education among women and the lower castes. He later became the
                    most-notable disciple of Ramakrishna, who demonstrated the essential unity of all religions.</p><br>
                <p>Always stressing the universal and humanistic side of the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of
                    Hinduism, as well as belief in service rather than dogma, Vivekananda attempted to infuse vigour
                    into Hindu thought, placing less emphasis on the prevailing pacifism and presenting Hindu
                    spirituality to the West. He was an activating force in the movement to promote Vedanta
                    philosophy (one of the six schools of Indian philosophy) in the United States and England. In
                    1893 he appeared in Chicago as a spokesman for Hinduism at the World's Parliament of Religions
                    and so captivated the assembly that a newspaper account described him as <q>an orator by divine
                        right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament.</q> Thereafter he lectured
                    throughout the United States and England, making converts to the Vedanta movement.</p><br>
                <p>On his return to India with a small group of Western disciples in 1897, Vivekananda founded the
                    Ramakrishna Mission at the monastery of Belur Math on the Ganges (Ganga) River near Calcutta
                    (now Kolkata). Self-perfection and service were his ideals, and the order continued to stress
                    them. He adapted and made relevant to the 20th century the very highest ideals of the Vedantic
                    religion, and, although he lived only two years into that century, he left the mark of his
                    personality on East and West alike.</p>

                <h2>Selected Teachings of Swami Vivekananda</h2>
                <p>Education is the manifestation of the perfection already in man.</p>
                <p>We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect
                    is expanded, and by which one can stand on one's own feet.</p>
                <p>So long as the millions live in hunger and ignorance, I hold every man a traitor who, having been
                    educated at their expense, pays not the least heed to them.</p>
                <p>Whatever you think, that you will be. If you think yourselves weak, weak you will be; if you
                    think yourselves strong, strong you will be.</p>
                <p>Strength, strength it is that we want so much in this life, for what we call sin and sorrow have
                    all one cause, and that is our weakness. With weakness comes ignorance, and with ignorance comes
                    misery.</p>
                <p>The older I grow, the more everything seems to me to lie in manliness. This is my new Gospel.</p>
                <p>Purity, patience, and perseverance are the three essentials to success, and above all, love.</p>
                <p>My ideal, indeed, can be put into a few words, and that is: to preach unto mankind their
                    divinity, and how to make it manifest in every movement of life.</p>
                <p>Religion is realization; not talk, not doctrine, nor theories, however beautiful they may be. It
                    is being and becoming, not hearing or acknowledging; it is the whole soul becoming changed into
                    what it believes.</p>
                <p>Religion is the manifestation of the Divinity already in man.</p>
